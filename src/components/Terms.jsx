        Booking and Financial Terms for Operator
      </Heading>

      <Text mb={4}>
        If you are an Operator and a booking is requested for your Group Tour
        via the Services, you will be required to either confirm or decline the
        booking using Weekend Feels's Messaging System within the specified
        timeframe (which is generally within 24 hours of when the booking is
        requested, as determined by Weekend Feels in its sole discretion) or
        the booking request will be automatically accepted. If you decide to
        decline the booking of a Tour within the specified timeframe, any
        amounts collected by Weekend Feels for the requested booking will be
        refunded to the applicable Traveller's source of payment. You
        understand and agree that once a Traveller requests a booking of your
        Group Tour, the price for such booking may not be altered after you
        confirm the booking without first obtaining the Travelers consent. If
        you have not yet confirmed the Traveller's booking you can amend the
        price, details, add discounts, food funds, single supplements and other
        local payment so long as you advise the Traveller of these changes
        before you confirm the booking to allow Travelers to consent to your
        changes.

        When a booking is requested via the Services, we may share with you the
        first and last name and contact details of the Traveller who has
        requested the booking. The Deposit amount displayed on the booking page
        is set with mutual consent of Weekend Feels and You. Where applicable,
        Taxes may be charged in addition to the Group Tour Cost. The Group Tour
        Cost and applicable Taxes are collectively referred to in these Terms
        as the 'Total Cost'. The amounts due and payable by a Traveller solely
        relating to an Operator's Group Tour are the 'Tour Cost'. Please note
        that it is you and not Weekend Feels which determines the Tour Cost and
        you agree this Cost will be exactly the same Cost stated on your
        website.
